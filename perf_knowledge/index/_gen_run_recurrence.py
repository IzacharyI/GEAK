"""Roll up the learned card trees into base rates, and publish them as `index/run_recurrence.md`.

Run from the repo root (or anywhere — paths are resolved from this file):

    python3 perf_knowledge/index/_gen_run_recurrence.py            # rewrite the digest
    python3 perf_knowledge/index/_gen_run_recurrence.py --check    # exit 1 if stale, write nothing
    python3 perf_knowledge/index/_gen_run_recurrence.py --json     # the same data, machine-readable

WHY THIS EXISTS
A learned card is one run's conclusion, and the card tree has no way to say "this held again".
`confirms_cited` counts re-citations of the SAME card, so the far more common shape — twelve
independent runs on twelve different kernels each concluding, separately, that the dispatch path was
already at its floor — leaves twelve cards and no aggregate anywhere. The single most useful thing
that pile knows is a base rate, and a base rate is exactly what a per-card format cannot hold.

So this reads all the cards and reports, per optimization axis: on how many DISTINCT kernels it paid,
on how many it was already closed, and which cards say so. That is the number a planner wants before
spending a round, and it lives in `perf_knowledge/` because it is a prior about the hardware and the
operator, not about any one run.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
It never restates a claim. Every row is counts plus links; the sentences stay in the cards. That is
deliberate and it is the whole safety argument: a generator that paraphrased 135 cards into curated
prose would be inventing the one thing nobody measured — the generalization — and `perf_knowledge`'s
consumption contract (advisory evidence and candidate cards, never final verdicts) forbids exactly
that. It also makes the
"ratios, never absolutes" rule automatic, since no card text is copied at all.

It reports BOTH sides of every axis, always. A digest of only the wins is a worse prior than no
digest: 56 of the 135 cards here are anti-patterns, and on several axes the closed side is the
majority verdict. Hiding that would sell an axis the tree has already measured shut.
