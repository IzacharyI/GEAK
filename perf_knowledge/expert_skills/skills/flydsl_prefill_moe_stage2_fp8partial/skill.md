## When to use
Trigger on the **problem signature, not a specific model**: a **grouped-GEMM MoE stage-2 (down-proj + top-k
reduce)** at **prefill / large-M** on gfx950 that is **HBM-traffic-bound on the per-(token, top-k slot) partial
tensor**. Down-proj writes `top_k` partial rows per token and the reduce sums them, so that partial is the
largest stage-2 HBM stream — written once and read once. Applies where the down path runs the **non-accumulating**
variant (each expert-slot's partial stored standalone, then summed) with a full-width (bf16) final output.

## Mechanism
With `top_k` experts per token, stage-2 materializes `top_k` partial rows per token and then reduces them. At
bf16 that partial is **2 bytes/elem** written by the GEMM and read back by the reduce — pure traffic that
dominates stage-2 at prefill. Storing the partial as **fp8 (1 byte)** halves **both** the write and the read,
cutting the reduce's HBM traffic ~2x.

Precision comes from where the fp8 lives: keep the **MFMA and accumulation at full width** (bf16 datapath,
f32 accumulate) — **only the global partial store and its matching load are fp8.** Down-proj partials have a
narrow, stable dynamic range, so a single **symmetric scale `s`** applied before the fp8 store, with `1/s`
applied right after the fp8->f32 unpack in the reduce (before summation), keeps the values centered in the fp8
representable range; `s` cancels exactly in the f32 sum. The only lossy step is the fp8 round-trip of the
**stored partials** — small and bounded (cos_sim 0.9986, logits_diff ~+0.0004 vs the bf16-partial baseline). It
is **not** a re-quantization of weights/activations and **not** a new kernel: the same GEMM+reduce with an fp8
store/load epilogue-prologue variant.

## Procedure
1. **Confirm the partial is the stage-2 HBM bottleneck** (traffic ~= `2 x top_k x tokens x N x dtype_bytes`; the
   reduce is bandwidth-bound). Engage only on the non-accumulating down path with a full-width output.
2. **Store side (down-proj GEMM epilogue).** Keep the CShuffle / accumulate datapath at bf16; at the **final
   global store** of each per-(token, slot) partial, multiply by scale `s` and convert to fp8 (e4m3). Allocate
   the partial buffer as fp8 (half the bytes).
3. **Reduce side.** Load fp8 partials, convert fp8->f32, multiply by `1/s`, **then** sum the `top_k` slots and
   write the full-width result. The unscale must happen before summation so `s` cancels exactly.
4. **Choose `s` from the partial magnitude histogram** so pre-store values sit mid-range in e4m3 — avoid
   saturation at the top and flush-to-zero at the bottom. `s` is data-dependent: re-derive it per model/quant;
   a fixed constant is valid only for the distribution it was calibrated on.
5. **Match the fp8 flavour to the arch** (gfx950 = OCP e4m3, not fnuz).
6. **Validate FULL-logits parity vs the bf16-partial baseline at prefill M** (this path is lossy, so it must
   stay within the accepted relaxed tolerance), then confirm with rocprof the reduce-kernel traffic cut (~2x).
7. **Score the A/B on the segment: down GEMM + reduce kernel, summed** (see `expects.isolated_scope`). Report
   the two kernels' before/after separately as well, so the write-side and read-side shares stay visible.

## Knobs & pitfalls
- **The store scale `s` is a calibrated constant, not a free knob.** Too large -> fp8 saturation (Inf / clamp);
  too small -> underflow to zero. Both **silently** degrade accuracy. Re-derive `s` from the actual partial
  distribution for any new model / shape.
- **Only valid on the non-accumulating down path** with a tile-N aligned to the fp8 store width and a full-width
  output; the accumulating / split-K path is **not** covered — leave it bf16.
- **It is a partial data-format change, not weight/activation re-quantization** — no model quant recalibration
  is needed, and it is the same kernel (fp8 store/load variant), not a replacement operator.
- **fp8 e4m3 flavour must match the GPU** (OCP on gfx950).
- **Measure the whole segment, or you will measure ~nothing.** The write-side saving lands in the down GEMM
  but the read-side saving — the larger share — lands in the *separate* reduce kernel, which has a different
  kernel name. A per-kernel timing filter matched on the GEMM's name silently drops the reduce and reports
  only the GEMM's ~1.045x, making a correctly reproduced recipe look like a failure. Time both kernels.

## Do-no-harm notes
- **Lossy by construction** (fp8 partial round-trip) -> this is a **relaxed-parity** optimization, never
  bit-exact. Keep it OFF for any model whose down-proj partial range has not been calibrated: a wrong scale is a
  **silent** precision loss, not a crash. Gate acceptance on full-logits parity within tolerance vs the
  bf16-partial baseline.
- Because acceptance depends on a model-calibrated scale **and** a parity check, it must never be applied blindly
  across shapes/models — an advisory prior gated by the workflow's on-box parity + A/B, never a default.
- The default path stores bf16 partials and is byte-identical to baseline -> no regression when not triggered.

## Sources
Evidence is external and cited for **provenance only** — GEAK does not depend on any tree, and exact
commits / file paths are intentionally omitted. The portable knowledge is the signature, mechanism, and
measured numbers below.

- **Reference measurement** (same-session; prefill large-M `~16k`, top-k reduce; fp8 activations / fp4 weights on
  gfx950 / MI355X). Scored on the **segment** (down GEMM + separate reduce): **1149.1 -> 979.8 us = 1.17x
  (-14.7%)**. Split, so the scope is unambiguous:
  - reduce kernel **288.1 -> 155.9 us = 1.85x** — 132.2 us, i.e. **78% of the 169.3 us saved**;
  - down GEMM **861.0 -> 823.8 us = 1.045x** (only the halved partial *write* lands here).
  An isolated micro-bench of the same GEMM+reduce segment gives **1182 -> 986 us = 1.20x (-16.6%)**.
  **parity within relaxed tol** (logits_diff `0.00142` vs `~0.00106` bf16-partial baseline, cos_sim `0.9986`).
- Implemented as an opt-in fp8-partial store/load variant of a FlyDSL grouped-MoE stage-2 GEMM+reduce; the
  default (bf16-partial) path is unchanged. Any rollout gating is an implementation detail of the reference,
  **not** part of this recipe — the transferable content is the store-fp8 / unscale-on-reduce technique above.
