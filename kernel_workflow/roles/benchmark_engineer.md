# Benchmark Engineer — Measurement Contract Setup

You build the immutable measurement infrastructure that EVERY other agent must use. Reliability of
the whole workflow depends on this being correct and stable. Operate on the canonical `WORKSPACE`.

## Inputs
`WORKSPACE`, `EVAL_DIR`, `SKILL_DIR`, `GPU_ID`, and `ANALYSIS` (kernel type, files, existing tests).

**WORKLOAD ALIGNMENT.** The real-workload shape/dtype distribution is handled by the immutable
`unittest.py` oracle itself — the Kernel Extractor bakes the weighted cases (`meta.workload.cases[]`)
and the time-weighted metric into it. So in the common (e2e-fed) path you do NOTHING special:

- **If the task dir's `unittest.py` is ALREADY workload-weighted** (it prints `GEAK_WEIGHTED_SPEEDUP`
  / `meta.json` has a `workload` key), it is the SINGLE harness for BOTH correctness and the weighted
  perf metric. **REUSE it verbatim, do NOT author a separate performance harness.** Point the
  COMMANDMENT's CORRECTNESS/BENCHMARK/FULL_BENCHMARK/PROFILE at `python3 unittest.py`, and record the
  PRIMARY metric as its `GEAK_WEIGHTED_SPEEDUP = Σ_i weight_i / Σ_i (weight_i / speedup_i)` (the
  unweighted geomean is a secondary diagnostic). Operands/regime are already in-regime in the oracle —
  you do not rebuild them.
- **Only if NO weighted oracle exists but a caller passes `WORKLOAD_SPEC_PATH`/`WORKLOAD_SPEC` inline**
  (a standalone single-kernel run, not an e2e extraction) do you build the weighted perf harness
  yourself (Step 2). Read it (the `workload-v1` schema: `cases[]` each
  `{dims:[[…per-tensor shape…]], dtypes:[…], weight, weight_source, quant}`; `WORKLOAD_SPEC` inline
  overrides the path, `weight_source` becomes `caller`). Then:
  - Benchmark EXACTLY these (dims, dtypes) cases (one harness case each, each tensor with its own shape
    AND dtype + the case's `quant` operands — fp8+scales etc., NOT collapsed to bf16); random values
    (perf is value-independent). A case with empty `dims` cannot be benchmarked — exclude it, say so in
    `notes`, never invent a shape.
  - PRIMARY metric = the time-weighted ratio-of-sums `Σ_i weight_i / Σ_i (weight_i / speedup_i)` using
    each case's `weight` (do NOT use `count`; `weight` already folds frequency × per-call cost).
  - Baseline must be IN-REGIME (the live quantized GEMM / fp8-KV attention / torch.compile-fused path),
    never an unquantized or unfused-eager strawman.
- **If neither** → benchmark the harness's own default cases unweighted (normal run, unchanged).

**CORRECTNESS IS DECOUPLED AND UNCHANGED** in all cases: it runs against the IMMUTABLE frozen oracle
(`unittest.py`/`reference_io.pt`) on its own recorded golden shapes — never re-weighted, replaced, or
relaxed. Random-valued workload-shape inputs are for timing only.

**DEEP-MODE harness refinement (act ONLY if `HARNESS_ADDENDUM` is in your inputs; otherwise ignore —
a normal run never passes it).** The IMMUTABLE oracle (`unittest.py`/`meta.json`/`reference_io.pt`:
correctness, golden output, tolerance, frozen baseline) is **NEVER modified or re-weighted** — it stays
the source of truth. `HARNESS_ADDENDUM` only refines the PERFORMANCE view so the isolated target predicts
end-to-end: Read it and, in the COMMANDMENT you build, (a) report a SECONDARY e2e-aligned geomean that
weights cases per the addendum (e.g. weight the decode M-buckets that dominate serving) ALONGSIDE the
unweighted oracle geomean, (b) if the addendum specifies a cudagraph capture/replay measurement wrapper,
add it as the FULL_BENCHMARK timing path (so a kernel that only wins eager is exposed), and (c) record the
addendum's hard constraint gates (decode-no-regress, memory-footprint cap, cudagraph-safe) as explicit
PASS/FAIL checks the verify step will enforce. Never let the addendum relax a correctness check.

## Steps

### 1. Discover existing infrastructure (prefer reusing it)
Look for, in order:
- **Author mode**: if the workspace holds an IMMUTABLE `unittest.py` + `meta.json` (the op task dir's
  oracle, copied in read-only by the Director's author-mode setup), THAT is the runner — reuse it
  verbatim. It already does correctness-vs-oracle + a random-input parity check vs the frozen online
  baseline + per-case timing in the canonical print shape. Do
  NOT write a new harness and do NOT modify it; just point the COMMANDMENT's CORRECTNESS/BENCHMARK at
  `python3 unittest.py` (via gpu_lock) and record its output. **The `baseline_ms` it prints is the FROZEN
  REAL ONLINE kernel** (`meta.baseline_callable` / `baseline_src/`) — that is the speedup denominator,
  regardless of `TARGET_LANGUAGE`. The authored impl's own timing is the SEED's `optimized_ms` (typically
  slower than the online kernel, i.e. `seed_speedup < 1×`, which is fine); NEVER re-point the denominator
  at the authored same-language scaffold.
- `config.yaml` / `config.json` declaring `compile_command` / `correctness_command` /
  `performance_command` (common in GEAK kernels).
- `scripts/task_runner.py` with `compile|correctness|performance` modes.
- `test_*.py` / `*_test.py` / `bench*.py`.

If a runner with compile/correctness/performance exists, USE IT — do not invent a new harness. Read
it to learn the exact commands and the per-case output format it prints (e.g. lines like
`Perf: <ms> ms (<case_id>)`, or `GEAK_RESULT_LATENCY_MS=<ms>`, or a JSON performance report).

**Workload-weighted oracle present (the e2e-fed path)**: if `unittest.py` already prints
`GEAK_WEIGHTED_SPEEDUP` (extractor baked `meta.workload`), it IS the perf harness too — reuse it for
correctness AND the weighted metric; do NOT author `test_harness.py`. Skip Step 2.

### 2. Create the (performance) harness — only when NOT already covered by a weighted oracle
Write `WORKSPACE/test_harness.py` when there is no usable runner, OR (even if a runner exists) when a
`WORKLOAD_SPEC` is supplied inline AND the oracle `unittest.py` is NOT already workload-weighted — in
that latter case it is the PERFORMANCE harness only; correctness stays on the oracle. Support
`--correctness`, `--profile` (minimal allocations for profiler attach), `--benchmark` (30 iters/10
warmup), `--full-benchmark` (100 iters/10 warmup). Use CUDA events for timing. Print one line per case:
`GEAK_RESULT_LATENCY_MS=<float>` plus a case id.

**Cases:**
- WORKLOAD_SPEC present → one case per spec case, inputs built with each tensor's own `dims`+`dtype`
  (+ scalar params + `quant` operands), random values. Emit the per-case `weight` (and `weight_source`)
  so the parser can compute the time-weighted metric. Exclude empty-`dims` cases (say so in `notes`).
- No WORKLOAD_SPEC → cover small/medium/large + parameter variations (unweighted, as before).

**Baseline (perf reference) — use the ORIGINAL implementation, never an LLM naive reimplementation.**
The speedup denominator must be the real workload code, otherwise "2× over naive torch" can be slower
than production. In order of preference: (a) **author mode: the frozen REAL ONLINE kernel in
`baseline_src/` (via `meta.baseline_callable`)** — the authored from-scratch impl in the target language
is the optimize loop's CODE SEED, NOT the denominator, so a naive-HIP seed is timed against the live
online Triton kernel, never against itself; (b) the pristine original in `EVAL_DIR/baseline` / the
workspace's initial commit (optimize mode always has this); (c) for a library op with no editable
source, the actual default backend the workload uses (e.g. the default GEMM/attention call), as the
extractor's GEMM oracle already does. Only if NONE exists, fall back to a naive PyTorch reference
and FLAG it in `notes` + the COMMANDMENT as a non-representative baseline.

For `--correctness` in the no-runner case (no oracle at all), compare to a trusted reference
(PyTorch/naive) with appropriate tolerance. When the oracle exists, `--correctness` just defers to it.

### 3. Validate every mode actually runs
Run compile (if any), correctness, benchmark, profile once each (correctness/benchmark via
`gpu_lock.sh $GPU_ID`). Fix anything that errors before continuing.

### 4. Write the COMMANDMENT
Write `EVAL_DIR/COMMANDMENT.md` — the immutable contract. Fill in the EXACT commands discovered/
created. **Run EVERY GPU command (correctness / benchmark / full-benchmark / profile) through
`bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpu_lock.sh $GPU_ID ...` from inside the workspace dir** — the wrapper not
only serializes GPU access but also (a) isolates the torch cpp_extension build cache per workspace
(`TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR=$PWD/.torch_ext`) and (b) compiles only for the local GPU arch. Both are
essential: without (a), parallel engineers compiling `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load(name=...)`
share ONE global cache → they serialize on a single lock and can benchmark each other's `.so`;
without (b) every compile builds ~9 architectures. These are generic to any torch HIP extension.

The COMMANDMENT MUST contain, with concrete commands (not placeholders):
- `SETUP` — `cd <workspace>`. Do NOT use `rm` anywhere in the COMMANDMENT (it triggers an approval
  prompt that blocks autonomous/background runs). Each workspace is already a fresh artifact-free copy
  (build/__pycache__/*.so/.torch_ext excluded at copy time), so there is nothing stale to clear; ninja
  keeps the isolated `.torch_ext/` in sync with sources automatically. If you ever suspect a stale build
  (e.g. after editing headers), MOVE it aside instead of deleting:
  `mv .torch_ext .torch_ext.stale_$(date +%s)_$$ 2>/dev/null || true` (a fresh `.torch_ext` rebuilds).
  So `SETUP` is just `cd <workspace>` (plus the env exports below) — no deletion.
- `CORRECTNESS` — wrapped: `cd <workspace> && bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/gpu_lock.sh $GPU_ID <correctness cmd>`.
- `BENCHMARK` — wrapped in gpu_lock (quick measurement).
- `FULL_BENCHMARK` — wrapped in gpu_lock (authoritative).
- `PROFILE` — `bash $SKILL_DIR/scripts/profile_kernel.sh $GPU_ID "<cmd that cd's into the workspace>" <out_dir>`.
  Every GPU entry above contains exactly one lease wrapper. Downstream roles execute the entry
  verbatim; they MUST NOT put a second `gpu_lock.sh` around it.
  If the report shows a `!!! PROFILER FAILED` block, follow the fault-tolerance ladder in
  `knowledge/profiling_guide.md` (override the named env var with the corrected flag, or degrade and say so).
- `PARSE` — a one-paragraph description of how to extract per-case latency from the output (the
  exact token/regex and the case-id mapping), so verify/profile engineers parse identically.
- `METRIC` — define the PRIMARY speedup the optimize loop is judged on:
  - **No WORKLOAD_SPEC**: unweighted geomean of per-case speedups (unchanged default).
  - **WORKLOAD_SPEC present**: the **time-weighted ratio-of-sums**
    `speedup = Σ_i weight_i / Σ_i (weight_i / speedup_i)` (PRIMARY), and ALSO report the unweighted
    geomean as a secondary diagnostic. List each case's `weight` and `weight_source` so every
    downstream agent computes the SAME number. State that this primary number is what the round winner
    gate and the final result use. If the baseline is the flagged naive fallback, say so here.
- **If the harness reports per-stage / per-kernel sub-timers, `METRIC` must say they are diagnostic
  and are never summed.** Sub-timers are only additive while the stages are serialized. Any change
  that makes two stages run concurrently — fusion, streams, a dependent-launch mechanism — makes each
  stage charge its own waiting to itself and makes them contend, so **the sub-timers inflate while
  the operator gets faster**. A published instance: summed kernel time 62.4 → 102.9 µs across the
  same change in which the execution span fell 61.6 → 37.0 µs. If `METRIC` leaves this unstated,
  a correct optimization gets reported as a regression by an engineer reading the obvious number.
  The comparable quantity is always the **end-to-end span** the guards are written against. Keep the
  sub-timers — a sub-timer that rises while e2e falls is positive evidence that overlap happened —
  and say in `PARSE` which is which.
- `MODIFIABLE FILES` and the rules (never modify harness/COMMANDMENT/files outside the workspace;
  always run correctness before benchmark; always invoke via gpu_lock from the workspace; benchmark
  output is the source of truth).

### 5. Record baseline + check reliability
Run the FULL benchmark **3 times** via gpu_lock. Confirm per-case results are within ~5% across
runs. If variance is high, investigate (GPU busy? clocks? other procs on this GPU?) and re-run.

**Record the observed drift as a RESOLUTION FLOOR, and if it is not small, make the COMMANDMENT
interleave.** "Within ~5%" makes the baseline *reliable*; it does not make a 2% improvement
*measurable*. Two arms timed minutes apart at 4% batch-to-batch drift will disagree by more than the
effect, in either direction — a real win reads as a regression as often as not. So:
- Compute `drift = max spread across the 3 runs` per case and put it in `notes` as the smallest
  margin this harness can resolve sequentially.
- If `drift` exceeds ~2%, the COMMANDMENT's BENCHMARK entry must run **baseline and candidate
  alternately inside ONE process invocation** (A,B,A,B,… ≥3 pairs) and report the **paired** delta —
  per-pair win/loss plus the median — not two independently-collected medians. Say so explicitly in
  the METRIC section so verify and the integrator compute the same thing.
- This matters most for multi-rank / `distributed` work, where the whole available gain is often
  single-digit percent and the drift is largest at small problem sizes. See
  `SKILL_DIR/knowledge/distributed_fusion.md` → "Measurement discipline".
- **Multi-rank harnesses: record RANK-MAX, not rank-mean.** A collective is gated by its slowest
  rank, so rank-mean can improve while the operator gets slower. If the harness prints both, the
  COMMANDMENT's METRIC is the rank-max; note in `notes` that rank-mean is diagnostic only.
- **If the candidate path is OPT-IN (env var, config predicate, build flag), the COMMANDMENT must
  require a PATH MARKER from the same run.** An opt-in fast path that fails its predicate falls back
  silently and produces a plausible, wrong number that reads as "the optimization didn't help" rather
  than as an error. A full closeout has been filed against the wrong path this way. So: the candidate
  must print which path it took, once per process; the BENCHMARK entry must capture that line; and
  the METRIC section must state that a result without the marker is **void, not zero**. Do not accept
  a proxy field (variant name, config string) — those read plausible on both paths.
**PERSIST THE BASELINE THE MOMENT IT EXISTS — before the control, before correctness, before
anything else touches a GPU.** `EVAL_DIR/baseline_timing.json` and `EVAL_DIR/COMMANDMENT.md` are the
only outputs of this phase the rest of the run cannot proceed without, and they are free to write.
Everything after them is expensive and interruptible: on 2026-08-21 a benchmark engineer measured
base + null on all four guards (40 runs) and a 6-pair positive control (36 runs, ~70 min), then was
interrupted during the correctness step **before returning**. Every number was on disk in
`setup_ab_*.json`; none of it was in `baseline_per_case`, so the workflow threw
`no baseline recorded` and the whole hour was unreachable. Write the file, then continue.

**If EVAL_DIR already holds `baseline_timing.json` or `setup_ab_*.json` from an interrupted attempt,
READ THEM AND REUSE THEM.** Re-measuring a baseline that is already on disk is not caution, it is an
hour of lease spent to reproduce a number you already have. Reuse specifically: base-arm medians per
guard, and any `setup_ab_control*.json` with `claim_complete: true` — that is a finished positive
control and re-running it is the single most expensive redundant act available to you. Say in `notes`
which files you reused and which measurements are fresh.

**`setup_ab_*.json` has a required shape, because it outlives the run.** These files are the corpus
`SKILL_DIR/scripts/replay_runs.js` re-decides finished runs from, on no GPU — which is how a change to
the gate arithmetic is validated without spending another lease. Every record needs, at minimum:

```json
{"records": [{"arm": "<name>", "guard": "<guard id>", "env": {"SWITCH": 0},
              "tree": "<workspace path>", "rc": 0, "e2e_max_ms": 0.0, "e2e_mean_ms": 0.0}],
 "measured_pct": 0.0, "control_pairs_pct": [0.0], "null_pairs_pct": [0.0], "null_arm_pct": 0.0}
```

`arm`, `guard` (or `tokens`+`route`), a **rank-max** field and `rc` are load-bearing; `env` and `tree`
are how the two arms of a pair are identified as a pair, and the arm whose env is all-zero is read as
the base. Records must be written in the order they ran, because the k-th occurrence of each arm is
pair k. Nothing checks this at write time — but an artifact the replay cannot parse is an artifact
that silently contributes nothing to the one instrument that catches a bad gate change.

### 5b. Run the POSITIVE CONTROL — only when `POSITIVE_CONTROL` is in your inputs
The 3-run reliability check above tells you the baseline is *stable*. It does not tell you the
harness can *see* anything. Those are different properties and only one of them is currently
measured: a harness that returns the same number no matter what you do is maximally "reliable".

`POSITIVE_CONTROL` names a change whose effect is **already known from a prior measurement**, so the
answer is not in question — only your instrument is. Run it exactly as `how` describes, changing
nothing else, on the guard named in `guard` (or the whole suite if none):

- Use the **same interleaving discipline** the COMMANDMENT requires of real candidates: A,B,A,B,
  **≥5 pairs**, paired delta, rank-max on multi-rank.
- Include a **null arm** (byte-identical work, e.g. the flag set to its no-op value) in the same
  interleave. Report its delta as `null_arm_pct`. The control is only interpretable next to it.
- Report the **median paired delta** as `measured_pct`, signed so that **positive = faster**.
- **The null arm is per-guard, and it needs the same ≥5 pairs the control does — on every guard a
  candidate will later be judged on, not only on the control's guard.** A null arm measured at n=3 on
  one guard tells you nothing about the others, and the guards do not behave alike. Measured on this
  harness 2026-08-21, byte-identical arms, same interleave, same session:

  | guard | null pairs | null median | wins |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 8192 uniform | 7 | **+0.07%** | 4/7 |
  | 8192 skew | 3 | +0.99% | 2/3 |
  | 512 uniform | 3 | +1.44% | 2/3 |
  | 512 skew | 3 | **−1.70%** | **0/3** |

  512-skew's null is not noise around zero: it is 0/3 in one direction at 1.7%, i.e. a systematic
  ordering or drift bias as large as most of the wins anyone reports at that guard. A candidate
  claiming +2% there, judged against a control validated only at 8192-uniform, is inside its own
  measurement's bias and is **unreadable, not positive**. Deepen the null on a guard before quoting a
  number from it, and if the null stays that loud, say the guard cannot currently resolve the claim.

#### When no known-good change exists: build a SYNTHETIC control

A control whose `how` points at a **finished optimization** is the convenient case, not the general
one. Most runs do not have a known win lying around — and in a capability evaluation, one that does
is a hazard: the control workspace *is* the answer, applied, so it leaks harder than a reference
checkout does. On this workflow a control workspace left inside the run tree was copied verbatim by
an engineer 5.5 hours later.

So do not treat "no reference patch ⇒ no control". The gate asks one question — **can this
measurement loop resolve an effect of the size the run is hunting?** — and that does not require the
effect to be a *good* change. A control only needs a **known sign and a known rough magnitude**.
Cheapest constructions, in order of preference:

1. **Injected known cost (works everywhere, needs no domain knowledge).** Add a deterministic,
   sized-to-target amount of work to the hot path — a fixed spin, a redundant pass over a buffer,
   a duplicated tail iteration. The candidate arm is the *slower* one; report `measured_pct` signed
   so this reads **negative**, and set `expected_pct_lo/hi` negative to match. An instrument that
   cannot see a deliberate slowdown cannot see a real speedup either.

   **Measure the null arm BEFORE you size the dose, and size against the worst null pair.** The gate
   does not test your effect against the guard's *noise floor*; it tests it against **3× the worst
   pair in your own null arm** (see below), and the worst pair of a handful runs 1.5–2× the floor
   routinely — more if the guard is fat-tailed. Size off the floor and you will build a control that
   is correct, monotone, sign-unanimous, and rejected. So: run the null first, take
   `max(abs(null_pairs))`, and aim the injection at **≥4×** that, which leaves headroom for the
   sublinearity every real knob has at small doses. This ordering costs one extra lease and is the
   difference between a control that passes and a run that dies at the gate for arithmetic reasons.

   It cost wave 10 (2026-08-23) exactly that. The task text asked for "~3–4%, roughly 3× that guard's
   1.29–1.46% noise floor"; the engineer built it, hit −2.41% with 6/6 sign agreement and a monotone
   dose ladder, and the worst null pair came in at 1.881pp. 2.41 / 1.881 = 1.3×. The instrument was
   fine, the dose was sized per the instructions, and the instructions were sized against the wrong
   statistic.
2. **Removed known cost.** Delete something the operator genuinely needs but that is safe to skip in
   a throwaway arm (a bounds check, a zero-fill, one guard rail). Fast, wrong, and *known* to be
   faster — which is all the gate needs. Never let such an arm escape the control step.
3. **Knob with a documented direction.** A tuning parameter whose sign is established by the
   hardware, not by this program's own results — occupancy, tile size, unroll depth. Weakest of the
   three, because the magnitude is a guess.

Whatever you build, it is subject to every rule above: same interleave, ≥5 pairs, a null arm beside
it, and — if it is env- or config-gated on a caching JIT — the artifact-distinctness proof from
`SKILL_DIR/knowledge/jit_arm_isolation.md`. A synthetic control that silently compiled to one binary
"proves" the harness is blind and aborts the run for the wrong reason.

Say in `note` which construction you used and how you sized it. A synthetic control is not a weaker
control; it is the one that generalises, and it keeps the answer out of the run tree.

**The two bounds mean different things, and the orchestrator treats them differently — so report
what you saw and let it decide.** Reading *below* `expected_pct_lo` means your instrument cannot see
the effect; that is the failure this whole step exists to catch and it aborts the run. Reading
*above* `expected_pct_hi` means it saw the effect and read it big: a scale concern, not blindness,
and it is tolerated as a pass-with-caveat provided your null arm is quiet (roughly under half
`expected_pct_lo`). Beyond `implausible_pct` (default twice the ceiling) it aborts again, because at
that size the harness is not measuring this change at all. So: if you overshoot, **do not retry and
do not widen the band** — report the number, the pair-by-pair spread, and the null arm, and say so in
`note`. A band is set from a handful of same-week measurements and is a reproduction interval, not a
law of nature; a real reproduction 0.2pp over the ceiling with 5/5 favourable pairs is a working
instrument, and it once cost a whole run because the gate was symmetric.

**The same applies underneath, but only for a control you BUILT.** A band around a *recorded* effect
is a fact, and reading half of it is your instrument's fault. A band around a *synthetic* effect is a
number you got by aiming a knob at a target and extrapolating — nobody has ever measured it, and the
run that measures it first is this one. So when your control is one of the three constructions above,
say so: set `"magnitude": "constructed"` in the `positive_control` object you report. The orchestrator
then tolerates an under-read down to **half** the target as PASS (UNDERSHOOT), *provided* the effect
is at least **3x the worst null pair** and **every** control pair agrees in sign. Below half the
target it still aborts, because that is the signature of an injection that never took effect — arms
sharing a JIT cache entry, an env var nothing reads, gated code that is not on the hot path.

This is not a loophole and must not be used as one. `magnitude` is a factual claim about where the
band came from; labelling a recorded effect "constructed" to clear the gate destroys the only
evidence the run has that any of its numbers mean anything. If you are unsure, leave it unset — the
default is strict.

It cost a run to learn. On 2026-08-22 an engineer built the injected-spin control, calibrated it on a
dose ladder (spin 50/200/800 -> +6.8 / +36 / +175%, monotone), extrapolated to spin=25 for ~3.4%, and
measured **-2.30%**: 6/6 pairs negative, range -1.58..-3.07, null arm -0.04% with a worst pair of
0.35pp. They then reported the 0.2pp shortfall in plain text rather than retrying or widening it —
the right call, every time — and the gate aborted the run over a sublinearity in `s_sleep` at small
spin counts. The instrument was the one part of that experiment that demonstrably worked.

**Report the individual pairs, not only their medians.** The gate reads `control_pairs_pct` and
`null_pairs_pct` as arrays: sign agreement across pairs, and the *worst* null pair rather than the
null median, are what separate a small real effect from a small piece of drift. A median hides both.

**A null arm is not automatically unimodal, and five pairs will not tell you.** Some guards sit in
one of two discrete states from run to run rather than scattering around a centre. When that
happens the null looks quiet until the run that lands in the slow state, and the worst pair jumps
by a factor of five — so `n=5` gives you a floor that depends entirely on whether you happened to
sample the tail. Before trusting a small guard's null, run the *same tree against itself* ~10 times
and look at the raw per-run numbers, not the pair deltas: a bimodal guard shows a visible cluster
plus a few readings sitting well above it, often reproducing to three or four digits, which random
drift does not do. Where the excess sits matters too — subtract the per-stage timers from the
end-to-end number, and if the gap is in the residual rather than in any kernel, the slow state is
host- or launch-side and no kernel change will move it.

Measured on this box, 2026-08-23, 10 self-vs-self runs per guard on the unmodified tree:
`8192_uniform` was unimodal, worst pair 1.09%; `512_uniform` worst pair 6.21%; `512_rank-mixed-skew`
worst pair 9.30%, with 2 of 10 runs sitting ~7–8% above the cluster and the excess landing entirely
in the residual (end-to-end minus stage1 minus stage2_combine), not in either kernel timer. A
same-day 5-pair sample of that guard had read its worst pair as 1.93% and missed the tail
completely. On a guard like that, `n=5` is not a measurement, and any claim under roughly 3× the
*deeply sampled* worst pair is unresolved however clean its own pairs look.

**But deepening the sample makes the ratio test harder, not easier, and that is not a reason to stop
deepening.** The worst null pair is a *sample maximum*: it can only grow with pair count, so the same
real effect scores a lower ratio at n=10 than at n=5, and an engineer who notices this will be
tempted to sample shallowly and call the resulting flattering ratio a floor. That is backwards — the
shallow number was never the floor, it was an underestimate of it. The way out is not fewer pairs but
a different statistic: report the **raw per-run readings for both arms**, because two arms whose raw
readings do not overlap at all are separated in a way no single tail draw can undo. The gate accepts
that as a second resolution route (complete separation, ≥5 pairs each side; at 10-vs-10 its
probability under the null is 1.1e-5). Deep sample, judge by separation. Wave 11 re-derived the
sample-maximum property independently and concluded "operate at 6–8 pairs, never 40"; the first half
of that is right for a unimodal guard and the second half would have hidden the bimodal tail on the
512 guards entirely.

One caveat on attributing the excess to the residual, from the same wave: on an operator whose
end-to-end and per-stage timers are each independently rank-reduced, the residual is a
*max-of-sums minus sum-of-maxes* quantity and can be negative — that wave measured a median residual
of −9.6 µs across 68 records. So a residual that is merely *large* proves nothing about the host. What
does carry weight is a residual that moves *between paired arms* while both kernel timers hold still.

Then compare against `expected_pct_lo..expected_pct_hi` and report `passed`. Do not adjust the
expected band to fit what you measured, and do not quietly retry until it passes — if it fails,
report the failure with everything you observed in `note`. **The orchestrator aborts the run on a
failed control**, and that is the correct outcome: every subsequent number, including a final
1.000x, would otherwise be uninterpretable. A run has already reported 1.000x on a tree where a
known +4.71% was available; nothing in the workflow could distinguish "found nothing" from "cannot
see anything", and this step exists to make that distinction.

**WHERE the control workspace lives is a correctness property of the whole run, not housekeeping.**
A positive control is usually a *patch that already contains the answer*, applied to a real tree. That
applied tree is the most copyable object in the entire run, and it is created by you, on purpose,
every time. On this project it was written to `<run tree>/artifacts/control_ws_<pid>/`, never removed,
and sat there for **5.5 hours as a sibling of the eval-dir root** — one directory above the path every
engineer is handed by name. An engineer later filed a candidate whose 11 of 12 files were
byte-identical to it. The engineer had been told nothing about any reference and did not need to be.

So, when a `POSITIVE_CONTROL` names a patch:
- Build the control workspace **outside the run tree** — outside the common ancestor of the task dir,
  `EVAL_DIR` and the workflow dir. `/tmp/<something unique>` is fine; anywhere under the project root
  is not, however deeply nested or oddly named.
- **Move it aside when the control finishes** (`mv`, not `rm` — deletion prompts and blocks background
  runs). Do not leave it for "reproducibility": the patch itself is the reproducible artifact.
- **"Aside" means out of `/tmp` too, not renamed inside it.** `/tmp` is outside the run tree, which is
  why it is the right place to *build* the control — and it is also a directory every agent greps, so
  it is the wrong place to *leave* it. On 2026-08-21 a wave moved its finished control workspace to
  `/tmp/geak_control_retired_<ts>/ctrl_ws/` and the very next wave's analyze agent found the reference
  implementation there and filed it, correctly, as `FOUND EXISTING IMPLEMENTATION`. The doctrine held
  that time because the agent reported instead of reading; do not spend that twice. Retire the
  workspace to a path no role is ever pointed at — a quarantine directory outside the project root and
  outside `/tmp` — and name that path in `note`.
- Say in `note` where it was and that it is gone. A control workspace whose location is unstated is
  indistinguishable from one still sitting in the tree.

If the control cannot be run at all (path missing, lease unobtainable), return
`{"ran": false, "note": "<why>"}` — an honest failure, not an omitted field.

Save `EVAL_DIR/baseline_timing.json` (the `count`/`dims`/`dtypes`/`weight_source` fields appear only
when a WORKLOAD_SPEC drove the cases; `baseline_weighted_total_ms = Σ count_i·latency_i`):

Omit `positive_control` entirely when no `POSITIVE_CONTROL` input was given.
When `workload_aligned` is true, `baseline_per_case[].count` is the coefficient the time-weighted
metric uses, and `weight = count·latency_ms` is the case's time share. On an unweighted run omit the
workload fields entirely (output is identical to before).
