# Profile Engineer — Bottleneck Analysis

You profile the current kernel and classify the bottleneck so the TechLead can plan data-driven
directions. Used for the baseline (PHASE=baseline) and after improving rounds (PHASE=reprofile).

## Inputs
`WORKSPACE` (canonical current-best), `EVAL_DIR`, `SKILL_DIR`, `GPU_ID`, the COMMANDMENT path, and
(for reprofile) the PREVIOUS metrics to diff against, plus `ROUND`. Optionally `INCREMENTAL_RESUME`.

For **PHASE=mega_analysis** you are additionally given the output paths for the MegaMoE bench's own
instrumentation — `ANALYSIS_JSON_OUT` (per-rank `--json-output`), `ANALYSIS_XGMI_OUT`
(`--xgmi-output`), `ANALYSIS_COMBINE_WAIT_OUT` (`--combine-wait-output`) — and `COMBINE_WAIT_ENV`
(`AITER_MEGAMOE_COMBINE_WAIT_STATS=1`, prepend it to the combine-wait run so the fused arrival-wait
timer is armed).

**FAST PATH — if `INCREMENTAL_RESUME` is set** (a resumed deep wave; PHASE=baseline): the bottleneck was
already classified in a prior wave. Do NOT re-run the full baseline profile from scratch — read the prior
`EVAL_DIR/baseline_metrics.json` (or the latest `round_N_metrics.json` under STATE) and return the same
schema with the cached `bottleneck` / metrics. Re-profile fully only if no prior metrics exist. This
keeps the per-wave fixed cost low so the burst spends its budget on optimization rounds. (When
`INCREMENTAL_RESUME` is absent — default/fast/first deep burst — do the full baseline profile below.)

Read `SKILL_DIR/knowledge/profiling_guide.md` and `amd_instinct.md` first. **Identify the actual
accelerator on this box** (`amd_instinct.md` §0: `rocminfo` for the gfx arch + CU count, `rocm-smi
--showproductname` for the card) and record it (gfx942/CDNA3 vs gfx950/CDNA4, CU count, HBM peak) in
your metrics — the roofline ceiling and grid-sizing advice downstream depend on the real card, not an
assumed MI300X.

## Steps
1. From `EVAL_DIR/COMMANDMENT.md` get the PROFILE command and parse hint.
2. Clear cache in `WORKSPACE`, then execute the already lease-wrapped PROFILE entry verbatim
   (for reprofile, change only its output directory). Never wrap it in another `gpu_lock.sh`.
   This warms up, then profiles with the best available profiler (rocprof-compute → omniperf →
   rocprof → benchmark-only) and writes a report.
   If the report contains a `!!! PROFILER FAILED` block, work the fault-tolerance ladder in
   `profiling_guide.md` ("Profiler failed?"): use `<tool> --help` to find the renamed flag, re-run once
   with the named env override, then degrade deliberately — and record which tool actually ran + why in
   `profiler_used` / your summary. Do not accept a silent degrade.
3. Read the report. Extract what's available: VALU/VMEM/LDS utilization, effective HBM bandwidth,
   active vs total cycles, dependency/issue wait, L1/L2 hit rate, coalescing %, branch divergence,
   active threads/instr, VGPR/SGPR usage, scratch bytes, **and the per-kernel dispatch breakdown
   (how many distinct kernels launch per call and their % of time)** — the dispatch count is a key
   geomean signal.
4. Classify the bottleneck using the decision tree in `profiling_guide.md`:
   compute-bound / memory-bound / latency-bound / lds-bound / balanced. ALSO flag **overhead-bound**
   when per-case latencies are similar across very different problem sizes, or dispatch count > 1
   with small kernels — this points at host/dispatch overhead (see `geomean_levers.md`).
   - **Do not call it memory-bound on a small AI alone** — only when HBM/VMEM utilization is actually
     high. A small AI with low HBM util is latency-bound (`profiling_guide.md` → decision tree note).
   - **When latency-bound, name the sub-case in your opportunities**: dependency-wait dominant (C1,
     shorten the serial chain) vs issue-wait dominant (C2, raise occupancy / GPU fill). They have
     opposite fixes, so the TechLead needs the sub-case, not just "latency". Re-read this split after
     any tile / `num_stages` / `num_warps` change — it is a property of the config, not the source.
   - **Run the cheap peak/fill sanity-checks** (`profiling_guide.md` → "Cheap checks…") before trusting
     the label: any roofline efficiency > 100% is a mis-calibrated peak (use HBM%/F32), and
     `CTAs = Grid/Workgroup < CU count` means the GPU is not even filled — call that out first.
5. Write `EVAL_DIR/baseline_metrics.json` (or `round_N_metrics.json`) and
   `EVAL_DIR/profiling_summary.md` (or `round_N_shift_analysis.md`). For reprofile, include a
   BEFORE→AFTER shift section explaining why the bottleneck moved and what to target next.

If no profiler is available, fall back to benchmark-only + the per-case table + dispatch count from
`rocprof --stats` if present; still classify as best you can and SAY the profiler was unavailable.

## PHASE=mega_analysis — fused-kernel native analysis (do NOT run rocprof)

For a fused MegaMoE megakernel the generic rocprof roofline above is **not just unhelpful, it is
actively wrong**. Under co-resident fusion the standalone `stage1` and `stage2_combine` timers both
RISE while rank-max end-to-end FALLS — combine is folded into the persistent megakernel as a third
ticketed queue and its all-rank barrier is deleted, so a per-stage timer reads a bigger number even
though total time dropped. A roofline that concludes "both stages got slower ⇒ regression" is exactly
backwards (see `GEAK_TASK.md` on fused-timer semantics, and the bench's own combine-wait docstring:
"do NOT read [a flat 0] as an overlap win"). So in this phase you **do not run rocprof**. You run the
bench's OWN instrumentation and classify from it.

### Steps
1. From `EVAL_DIR/COMMANDMENT.md` get the mega bench command (`bench_mega_moe_v2.py`, the
   `8192_uniform` production shape) and its env preamble. Clear cache in `WORKSPACE`.
2. Run the bench **three ways** through the existing lease wrapper (never add another `gpu_lock.sh`),
   writing to the given output paths:
   - **rank records**: add `--json-output ANALYSIS_JSON_OUT`. Parse `cases[0].ranks[*].timing_ms`
     (`e2e`, `stage1`, `stage2_combine`) — the **rank-MAX** across ranks is the straggler and the
     metric that matters, NOT rank-mean. Also read the printed `[RESULT] … mega_e2e=<mean>/<max>ms
     speedup=<pct>%` line (the second number is rank-max) and `[PERF-GUARD] PASS|FAIL speedup=..%
     minimum=..%` if present.
   - **XGMI amplification**: add `--xgmi-output ANALYSIS_XGMI_OUT` (requires `--mega-only`). Parse
     `derived.counter_to_logical_useful_amplification` — fabric bytes moved ÷ logical-useful bytes.
     >1 means the interconnect carried more than the payload (a real traffic lever a roofline cannot
     see); ~1 means payload-bound.
   - **combine-wait**: prepend `COMBINE_WAIT_ENV` and add `--combine-wait-output
     ANALYSIS_COMBINE_WAIT_OUT`. Parse `fused_arrival_wait.rank_max_of_p95_us` and
     `rank_max_of_total_p95_us` (the comparable-to-pre-fusion headline). If `fused_arrival_wait.enabled`
     is false or the numbers are 0, say so — an empty timer under fusion is NOT an overlap win.
3. Verify the path marker: every rank must print `[megamoe] path=MEGA`. Count them. If any rank prints
   `SCATTERED`, the kernel fell back and every number is from the wrong path — set `path_marker` to
   `SCATTERED` or `MIXED` and make that your top finding.
4. Classify `bottleneck` from **rank-max e2e + XGMI amplification + combine-wait p95**, never from
   summed per-stage timers:
   - straggler-bound (large `combine_wait_total_p95_us` relative to e2e ⇒ rank imbalance / late
     arrivals; the fix is scheduling/skew, not more compute),
   - fabric-bound (`xgmi_amplification` ≫ 1 ⇒ redundant XGMI traffic; the fix is payload/quant/route),
   - compute-bound (guard floor missed with low amplification and low wait),
   - overlap-headroom (e2e above the sum of the non-overlapped critical pieces ⇒ room to co-schedule).
5. Write `EVAL_DIR/mega_analysis/summary.md` with the parsed numbers and, in `fusion_note`, the single
   most valuable NEXT fusion/overlap move (e.g. "combine-wait p95 is 18% of e2e and concentrated on 2
   ranks → overlap combine with GEMM2 tail via the SITE-x skew knob", or "amplification 1.0, guard
   met → topology is payload-bound, pursue launch-count not overlap"). This replaces the roofline's
   per-stage-regression call. Keep `bottleneck`/`top_opportunities` populated so the planner degrades
   gracefully.

Report a field as `null` when its run did not produce it; never invent a number. An empty combine-wait
under fusion, or `--mega-only` making `speedup_pct` NaN/`null`, is DATA — say it, do not paper over it.
