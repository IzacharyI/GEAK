"""test_knowledge_reachable.py — the knowledge loop is closed in BOTH directions.

The return path (run -> card -> digest) has tests and CI gates. The read path had none, and it broke
silently: `run_recurrence.md`, `corpus/gemm_family.md` and `languages/flydsl/version_map.md` were all
generated, tested, gated and linked from three READMEs — and named by no role prompt at all. Every
`--check` passed. A human browsing the base would find them; the agent that plans directions never
would. A doc no role reads is a comment with a CI gate on it.

Two directions, and they fail for different reasons:

1. **Every `KERNEL_KNOWLEDGE_DIR/<path>` a role prompt names must resolve.** A role prompt is not
   code, so a renamed file leaves the prompt pointing at nothing and the agent silently reads less
   than it was told to — no error, just a worse plan. Paths with `<placeholder>` segments are
   resolved as far as their fixed prefix and counted, since `operators/<op>/overview.md` cannot be
   checked without knowing the op.

2. **Every artifact in `MUST_BE_READ` must be named by at least one role prompt.** Deliberately an
   explicit list rather than "everything marked GENERATED": most generated files here are machine
   inputs (`facts/*.yaml`), human navigation (`sota_matrix.md`) or skill internals, so a blanket rule
   would need an exemption list longer than the rule itself. Being explicit also puts the burden in
   the right place — adding a knowledge artifact should require saying who reads it, which is the
   question that went unasked.
