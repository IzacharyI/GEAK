"""test_kb.py — guards the learned-KB contract: the generated index, and the gates that admit a card.

Supersedes test_learned_index.js, whose assertions about the index are all kept below. It grew the
gate tests because the index contract was the only part under test: a malformed card could not break
the index (the generator skips it) but could still reach the read path, so "the index is correct" and
"the KB is correct" were different claims and only one had a test.

Pure stdlib on a throwaway tmp dir: no GPU, no agent, no repo mutation, no network.
