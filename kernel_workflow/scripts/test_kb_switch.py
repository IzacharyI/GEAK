"""test_kb_switch.py — `use_learned_kb=false` must reach EVERY reader of the learned KB.

The switch existed and did not work. It removed `LEARNED_KB_BUDGET` from the planner's inputs — the
block that CONSTRAINS how much of a round the KB may steer — while roles/tech_lead.md still listed
`knowledge/learned/INDEX.md` among the files to read, and roles/author_engineer.md did too. So
`use_learned_kb=false` dropped the limit and kept the instruction, and the KB-off control arm the
flag exists to produce was never actually KB-off.

The failure is not that a check was missing, it is that the switch was enforced per call site and a
call site lapsed. So this test derives the readers FROM THE TREE — any role file that names the
learned KB is a reader and must gate on the `LEARNED_KB` input — rather than from a list that a
third reader could be added without joining.
