# GPU lock + per-workspace build isolation wrapper.
# Usage:  cd <workspace> && bash gpu_lock.sh <gpu_id> <command...>
#
# Run EVERY kernel command (compile / correctness / benchmark / profile) through this wrapper,
# invoked from inside the workspace directory. It does three generic things — none kernel-specific:
#
#  1. flock per GPU id  -> multiple engineers can share GPUs safely (exclusive during the command).
#  2. TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR = <workspace>/.torch_ext  -> isolates the torch cpp_extension build cache
#     PER WORKSPACE. Without this, torch.utils.cpp_extension.load(name=...) compiles every engineer's
#     DIFFERENT source into ONE global cache (~/.cache/torch_extensions/...), which both serializes
#     all parallel compiles on a single global lock AND lets one engineer benchmark another's .so.
#     Deriving it from $PWD makes each isolated workspace get its own cache. (Honors a caller-set
#     TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR if already exported.)
#  3. PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH = the local GPU's gfx arch only -> avoids compiling for ~9 architectures
#     (huge compile speedup). Runtime perf and correctness are unaffected (the kernel runs on the
#     local arch either way). Honors a caller-set PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH if already exported.
