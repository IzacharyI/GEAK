"""Decide which authoring language a kernel is written in, from the source itself.

Why this exists: the lane's `TARGET_LANGUAGE` is a REQUEST, not an observation. It defaults to
`triton` and is only ever set by the caller, so on an optimize run -- where the language is whatever
the existing file happens to be -- it stays `triton` no matter what the kernel is. Feeding that into
a learned card labels every optimize-mode finding `triton`, which is worse than the `unknown` it
replaces: a wrong label is trusted, an absent one is not.

So the language is read off the source. Two rules make the answer trustworthy:

  * Never default. Ambiguous or unrecognised returns `null` with the reason, because the caller can
    handle "I don't know" and cannot handle a confident wrong answer.
  * Report the evidence. Every verdict carries the file, line and matched text that produced it, so a
    reviewer can check it without rerunning anything.

Usage:
    python3 detect_language.py PATH [PATH ...] [--entry KERNEL_SYMBOL] [--json]

PATH is a file or a directory (walked). --entry names the kernel symbol under optimization; files
defining it are weighted above the rest, which is what separates the kernel from its test harness.

Exit status: 0 when a language was decided, 1 when it was not. The caller is expected to branch on
that rather than parse prose.

# (language, pattern, weight, declares). Two independent axes, and conflating them breaks detection
# in both directions:
#
#   `declares`  -- does this marker mean the file IS written in the language, as opposed to merely
#                  referring to it? An import, a kernel decorator, an include of the language's own
#                  headers, `__global__`: yes. A namespace reference such as `ck_tile::`: no, a HIP
#                  kernel may call one CK utility without being a CK kernel.
#   `weight`    -- how much the match contributes when ranking languages that both declare.
#
# Measured on aiter, both mistakes are real. Treating `ck_tile::` as a declaration reported five
# plainly-HIP `.cu` files (15 `__global__` apiece) as `ck`, and one as `cutlass_port`. Then treating
# `__global__` as a mere mention made HIP undetectable in all 33.
