# Report (and optionally kill) GPU-lease jobs that have outlived the workflow that spawned them.
#
# Why this exists: an engineer that backgrounds a lease job (`nohup ... gpu_lock.sh ... &`) leaves a
# process whose parent is init. The orchestrator holds no handle on it, so the run finishes, the
# report is written, and the job is STILL QUEUED for the GPU group -- with a --wait-timeout and
# --run-timeout that can be hours. It then acquires the lease and runs to completion with nobody
# reading its output. Observed once for real; the orphan's result contradicted the filed report.
#
# Usage:
#   sweep_orphan_leases.sh [--kill] [--eval-dir <dir>]
#
#   (default)         report only, exit 0 if clean, exit 3 if orphans found
#   --kill            terminate what it finds (TERM to the process group, then KILL after a grace)
#   --eval-dir <dir>  only consider leases whose command line mentions <dir> (this run's jobs)
#
# Reporting is the default on purpose: killing a lease job that a HUMAN started, from an automated
# closeout, would be worse than the leak. Only pass --kill when you know the pool is yours.

# Do NOT test for PPID==1. The leaked process is usually the `nohup`-ed *wrapper shell*, whose own
# child (gpu_lease.py) still has a live parent -- so a PPID==1 filter matches the wrapper and misses
# the thing actually holding the lease, or misses both if the wrapper exited and the lease was
# re-parented under some other long-lived shell. The reliable signal is ownership, not lineage:
# a lease job that names THIS run's EVAL_DIR, after this run has finished, is by definition stale.
#
# Hence: --eval-dir is what makes a match actionable, and --kill REQUIRES it. Without it we only
# list every lease process on the box, so a human can look.
