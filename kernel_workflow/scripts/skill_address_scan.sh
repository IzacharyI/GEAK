# skill_address_scan.sh -- fail if an injected expert-skill card contains an address that RESOLVES
# to a reachable copy of the answer.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, SEPARATELY FROM reference_leak_sweep.sh
# --------------------------------------------------------
# The sweep looks for reference *content* copied into the run tree. This looks for the shorter path:
# a knowledge card that simply tells the engineer where the finished implementation lives. On
# 2026-08-21, with capability_eval on and use_expert_skills=true, the megamoe_ep_persistent_fusion
# card opened its Procedure with
#
#     Reference implementation: `AITER` branch `geak/megamoe-v2-candidate`, HEAD `<9-hex sha>`.
#
# and cited five more commits in Sources. That card is read off disk by the engineer agent, so the
# orchestrator cannot redact it at injection time, and the run was asking that same engineer to
# DERIVE the megakernel. Prose in the injected block already said "use the mechanism, never the
# addresses"; prose had already proved insufficient twice.
#
# THE RULE IS RESOLVABILITY, NOT CITATION
# ---------------------------------------
# A commit hash in a Sources section is normal, honest provenance and most of them point at repos
# this machine cannot see (another skill cites `d7e8df1` in an internal perf-knowledge repo -- that
# is a citation, not a door). Failing on every hex token would push authors to strip real provenance
# and would cry wolf until it got switched off. So the test is the property that actually matters:
#
#     does this address resolve to a commit in a repository the run can reach?
#
# A citation that resolves nowhere passes. A citation that `git cat-file -t` turns into a commit from
# inside the run tree is an address, and it fails -- one `git show <sha>:<file>` away from the answer.
#
# Repos searched: every .git discoverable under the scan root, plus $AITER_JIT_DIR's repo (GEAK_TASK
# points every engineer at that one by name), plus anything given with --repo.
#
# THE SAME RULE, APPLIED TO FILESYSTEM PATHS
# ------------------------------------------
# A git sha is not the only kind of address. `/outside/hidden-reference/reference.patch`
# in a card is the same door with a shorter walk, and the git pass cannot see it. So the second pass
# asks the identical question of every absolute path a card names:
#
#     does this path exist, and can this uid read it?
#
# Symmetric to the git rule, and for the same reason: a path that names another machine's layout is a
# citation and passes; one that opens here is an address and fails. Three things are deliberately NOT
# findings:
#   * relative paths (`aiter/ops/flydsl/...`) -- they resolve against the engineer's own workspace,
#     which is the tree the task is asking them to edit. Naming the file to modify is the job.
#   * system prefixes (/usr, /opt/rocm, ...) -- present on every box, carry nothing.
#   * a path that EXISTS but this uid cannot read -- reported as CONTAINED, not as a failure.
#     READ THE CAVEAT: root ignores permission bits, so under uid 0 that branch is unreachable and
#     `chmod 000` on a quarantine tree contains NOTHING. This was going to be the plan for the
#     reference trees, and the scanner is where the assumption gets tested rather than assumed:
#     running as root, the only real containment is to move the tree off the machine or delete it.
#     The scan says so out loud when it finds an open path while uid 0.
# Add `--allow-prefix DIR` for a tree the cards may legitimately point into; the workflow's own
# directory is allowed by default, since a card citing `knowledge/foo.md` by absolute path is citing
# the workflow, not the answer.
#
# SCOPE: a scanner for INJECTED KNOWLEDGE, not a tree audit. Pointed at a whole project it also
# reports that project's own commits -- correct by its rule, useless as a signal, because the question
# there is not "does this hash resolve" but "is this a copy of the answer", which reference_leak_sweep.sh
# answers by content. Use each for what it sees.
#
# Exit: 0 clean, 1 resolvable address found, 2 bad invocation.
