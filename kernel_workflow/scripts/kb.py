`--kb-dir` is REQUIRED and has no default. There are two trees in this repo
(`kernel_workflow/knowledge/learned/` for kernel-level levers, `e2e_workflow/knowledge/learned/` for
e2e routing/config) and they must not be mixed. A default would quietly make this a single-tree tool
again, which is how the contract drifted apart in the first place: two copies of a rule, and the
second one lapsed — the e2e INDEX now carries a "MANDATED LEVER" and a "do NOT use it" that its own
README forbids. One implementation, two data dirs.

Why the commands split the way they do
--------------------------------------
`match` and `propose` run inside a live campaign — up to 8 drivers per host, on two hosts sharing one
NFSv3 mount. Neither takes a lock: `match` only reads, and `propose` creates one file whose name
contains the run id, so two writers can never collide.

`drain` is the ONLY writer of INDEX.md / cards / _archive.md, run by one operator between campaigns.
That is not merely lock-avoidance: "MERGE if the key already exists" is not implementable
concurrently, because 20 curators cannot see each other's proposals and would each insert a
near-duplicate for the same key. One writer holding the whole inbox dedupes correctly, and gives a
human a review gate over what enters the KB.

# Was 8, and 8 was measured to be wrong. On a 121-card corpus it archived 60 cards — half the KB —
# and it took them from exactly the classes that had the most to say: 24 of 32 from
# `moe_grouped_gemm`, 16 of 24 from `attention_decode`. The comparison arm read 78 cards with none
# trimmed; this one read 61, and lost worst (-32%) on `fused_moe_kernel`, a `moe_grouped_gemm` kernel
# whose class had been cut by 75%.
#
# The reasoning behind 8 was that a prolific class would otherwise crowd out a sparse one. That
# confused fairness with usefulness: a class has more cards mostly because more was learned about it,
# and `match`/the reader select BY CLASS anyway, so a big `moe_grouped_gemm` shelf never competes for
# attention with `quantize_cast`. Trimming it only destroys priors.
#
# 32 is the largest class in the current corpus, i.e. nothing is trimmed today. It stays a cap rather
# than becoming unbounded because the index is read whole by a planner and an index that grows without
# limit eventually costs recall — but the next value should be chosen from a measurement, not from a
# tidiness instinct, and it should be raised before it is allowed to bind. Overridable via
# KB_CLASS_CAP so an operator can test a different budget without editing code.

# forbidden from naming a kernel, so the symbol genuinely was not recoverable) produced 11 invented
# symbols across the corpus, one of them, `fused_moe_grouped_gemm`, in 17 cards. A grep aid that
# sends the reader to the wrong card is worse than an absent one. Optional, and checked when given.
# The language the card's finding was measured in. Required on a NEW card and absent from the 135
# cards that predate it -- deliberately not backfilled, for the same reason `kernels` is optional:
# nobody can recover it from a card body that is forbidden from naming a kernel, so a backfill would
# be a guess, and this field only earns its place if a reader can trust it.
#
# Why it is required going forward: the read path is "open INDEX.md, judge by meaning", and until now
# the index carried no language at all. A FlyDSL run therefore could not tell a FlyDSL card from a

# all absent), so `update_experience`'s instruction to regenerate after writing a card failed at the
# shell, and a card that never reaches INDEX.md is a card the read path cannot see. The design was
# sound and the runtime assumption was not.
#
# Ported rather than duplicated: the JS generator and its test are deleted in the same change. Two
# generators for one generated file drift, and a drifted index is exactly the failure the generated
# index exists to prevent.

Open the cards matching your run as **additional, advisory priors** — they only ADD candidate levers to
try, never remove any and never replace measurement. The frozen-baseline isolated A/B + oracle parity is
always the judge (see `README.md`). **Budget: <={CLASS_CAP} active cards per `kernel_class`** (the
axis `drain` evicts on; the whole-file total is unbounded by design). Confidence (a hint strength, not
authority): ★ noise/unverified · ★★ single non-overlap or >=2 consistent · ★★★ >=2 non-overlap.

Effects are **ratios or percent deltas only, never wall-clock or absolute throughput** — those vary box
to box and stay in the run's `EVAL_DIR` (see `README.md` -> "Content rules").

**How to use this file: READ it, then open the 0–3 cards that look relevant.** Each line carries the
card's own description, the kernel symbols it was measured on, and its keywords — enough to judge
relevance without opening anything. Match on *meaning*, not on an exact string: a card written for
`split-k on skinny-M GEMM` is worth opening for a tall-K GEMM too. If nothing matches, that is a real
answer — plan cold, exactly as this workflow does without any KB.

    # optimized most: ingesting one 20-kernel campaign put 15 cards in `moe grouped gemm ·
    # compute-bound` and 2 in `quantize / cast · mixed`, and under a flat cap the prolific class
    # evicts the sparse ones wholesale — the KB narrows toward whatever was worked on last, which is
    # the opposite of what it is for. `match` retrieves BY CLASS and only ever injects a few cards, so
    # breadth across classes is worth more than depth inside one.
    # Group by the MACHINE slots in the discovery header, not by `key`. `key` is deliberately plain
    # English here ("MXFP8 E8M0 dense linear, decode-bound · gfx950"), so two cards about the same
    # class would land in different buckets on a wording difference and neither would ever hit its
    # cap. The header fields are the ones the generator groups the index by, so the budget is
    # enforced on the same axis the reader browses.
    # Bucket by `kernel_class` — the SAME axis the generated index groups by, and the same one its
    # over-cap warning counts. Bucketing finer (class · platforms · regime) looked more careful and
    # was wrong: `moe_grouped_gemm · both`, `· mixed` and `· large-batch` are three buckets of 8, so a
    # class the reader sees as one heading held 11 cards under a cap of 8, and the generator warned
    # about a limit the evictor was not enforcing. The budget exists to bound what a reader scans, so
