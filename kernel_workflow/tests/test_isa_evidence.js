// Wiring guard for the ISA-level evidence doctrine distilled from wave 12.
//
// Wave 12 produced three findings that live entirely BELOW the source diff, and each guards a
// distinct way this workflow spends a lease to learn nothing:
//
//   1. LICM → spill. The compiler hoisting constant-folded addresses out of a peeled loop tail is
//      invisible in the source and shows up only as scratch in the kernel descriptor. Without the
//      detection recipe an engineer tunes the loop body forever; without the fragility warning the
//      inline-asm anchor becomes an unrecorded dependency on one compiler version.
//   2. Identical ISA as a RESULT. A guard whose two arms compile to the same binary cannot have
//      moved. Not knowing this converts a settled guard into ten more paired reps.
//   3. Per-guard compiled config. A change gated on one tile config is structurally unable to
//      touch a guard that compiles another; attributing a delta there is attributing noise.
