// The 512 guards are bimodal, and the statistic the doctrine prescribed for them cannot be computed.
//
// "Deep sample, judge by complete separation" is sound on a unimodal guard and unreachable on a
// bimodal one: both arms draw slow runs, the ranges interleave, and no depth of sampling separates
// them. So the two 512 guards sat demoted to regression-only while the effect being hunted (5-6%)
// hid under a 9.30% worst pair. Conditioning on the state is the way out — and conditioning is
// exactly the kind of tool that turns into a knob for manufacturing wins, so this suite spends most
// of its assertions on the ways it must REFUSE:
//
//   1. The split must be arm-blind. If which-arm-is-which can move the boundary, the boundary is a
//      free parameter and the engineer picks the one that flatters the candidate.
//   2. Refusing to classify must stay available. A classifier that always finds two clusters finds
//      them in pure noise, which is worse than the honest all-pairs analysis it replaced.
//   3. Occupancy must survive as a reported number, not be divided out. A candidate that enters the
//      slow state less often has the largest effect available on this guard; a fast-mode-only
//      report throws that win away as though it were noise.
//
// It lifts the pure region out of kernel_workflow.js the way replay_runs.js does.
