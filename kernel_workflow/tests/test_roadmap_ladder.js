// Behavioral test for the roadmap-ladder gate, plus the plumbing that makes it reachable.
//
// Same house rule as test_pipe_occupancy_gate.js: LIFT the shipped gate verbatim out of
// kernel_workflow.js between its `<<REPLAY:roadmap_ladder_gate>>` markers and run it. A grep test
// would go green the moment somebody writes the words.
//
// WHAT THE GATE IS FOR — and why the other two gates cannot cover it. taskGraphGate asks whether
// the dependency graph exists. pipeOccupancyGate asks whether each direction was priced against a
// busy or an idle pipe. Both examine the directions that WERE issued, so neither can see the
// direction that was never issued.
//
// A wave's Analyze produced a correct four-rung ladder ending in exactly the fused two-launch shape
// the program existed to reach, wrote it to roadmap.md and to analysis.json:candidate_directions,
// and then plan_round was handed neither artifact. Six directions were dispatched over three
// rounds. The bounding readout never ran; the rung the ladder itself designated as the positive
// control never ran, so the wave had no control and improvised a substitute mid-flight; the
// readiness rung ran first, without its own mandatory publish-only arm, and read negative; and the
// fusion rung, gated on it, was never proposed. The ladder was right and structurally an orphan.
// Every one of those losses is invisible per-direction and obvious the moment dispatched rungs are
// diffed against the ladder. Hence: one section per loss.
