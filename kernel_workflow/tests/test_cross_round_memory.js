// Cross-round memory: the loop's largest source of wasted budget, and until now the one diagnosed
// cause with no code behind it.
//
// The bug was a single assignment, `history.insights = mem.insights`. `update_memory` asks an agent
// to distil durable insights; an agent looking at one round's results returns that round's insights;
// the assignment discarded everything earlier it happened not to restate. So the board silently
// shrank to the most recent round, and engineers in round 3 re-proposed directions round 1 had
// already disproved — paying twice out of a budget counted in 8-card leases.
//
// These assertions run the real merge, lifted from between the `<<REPLAY:memory_merge>>` markers in
// kernel_workflow.js, on inputs shaped like the ones that caused the loss. They are behavioural: if
// someone restores the assignment, or quietly re-introduces silent eviction, they fail.
