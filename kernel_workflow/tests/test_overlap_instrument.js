// "Genuine compute/communication overlap, not serialization disguised by kernel boundaries" is an
// acceptance criterion that had no instrument behind it for several waves. The task text said a
// latency win with no measured overlap is "suspicious, not accepted", but there was no way to
// produce the measurement it demanded, so the honest answer was always "not measured" and the rule
// never bit once.
//
// The reason it is hard is that the fused shape blinds every instrument that would judge it: four
// launches give four trace records and settle overlap for free, one fused kernel gives one record,
// and the two per-stage timers both RISE when a stage is allowed to start early. So the only thing
// left pointing the right way is latency — and latency is precisely the quantity that cannot tell
// overlap apart from removed launch overhead or better L2 residency.
//
// This gate cannot manufacture the measurement. What it must do is stop "nobody measured it" from
// arriving in the report looking like "measured and fine", and stop an uncontrolled meter from being
// quoted as evidence. Every assertion below is a way that could silently go wrong:
//
//   - a missing field defaulting to the benign outcome (defect class B — the schema is
//     additionalProperties:true, so an omitted or renamed `overlap` validates)
//   - a meter nobody sanity-checked against the known-zero path
//   - a meter that reads 0 because it is dead, which looks identical to a conservative one
//   - concurrency with no latency win reported as partial success rather than as contention
