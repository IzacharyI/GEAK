// Every input a role file says it is given must actually be passed to it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — and why it is a different test from the other gates. Three separate defects,
// found three separate times by three separate waves failing, turned out to be one defect:
//
//   * Analyze wrote a four-rung roadmap ending in the fused two-launch shape the program exists to
//     reach. plan_round was handed neither roadmap.md nor candidate_directions. The top rung was
//     never proposed.
//   * Analyze produced `task_graph` and `resource_timeline`. pipeOccupancyGate rejected directions
//     whose claims exceeded their pipe's idle fraction — judging the planner against a table the
//     planner had never seen. The graph, the one artifact that says which work has NO EDGE between
//     it and other work, went only to the end-of-wave Report.
//   * Analyze produced `modifiable_files`. verify_engineer.md step 5 says to diff the patch's file
//     list against `MODIFIABLE_FILES` and reject anything outside it. Nothing ever passed it, so
//     verify compared against a list it did not have.
//
// In all three the artifact existed, was well-formed, was named in the consuming role's own
// contract, and was never threaded. Each was found by a wave burning a lease and coming back with
// nothing. Each fix was one line. That ratio is why this test exists: the class is cheap to check
// statically and expensive to find dynamically.
//
// The check is: for every `roleAgent(role, phase)` call, collect the keys actually passed; for every
// role file, collect the ALLCAPS names it declares as inputs; assert the second is a subset of the
// first. EXEMPT below is the escape hatch, and every entry carries the reason it is not a defect.
