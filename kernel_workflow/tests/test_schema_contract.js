// Every field a gate reads must be DECLARED in the schema, not only described in a comment.
//
// This is the mirror of test_input_contract.js. That one checks inputs: does the role receive what
// its contract says it receives. This one checks outputs: when a gate reads `x.foo`, was the agent
// that produced `x` ever actually required to return `foo`?
//
// WHY IT IS A DEFECT AND NOT A STYLE POINT. `obj()` sets `additionalProperties: true`, so a schema
// entry of `{ type: 'object', additionalProperties: true }` accepts ANY object. Four of the most
// load-bearing artifacts in this workflow were declared that way, with their real shape written in
// the comment above them. In every case the gate's handling of a MISSING field is a default, and in
// every case the default reads as the benign outcome:
//
//   positive_control  — `pc.ran !== false` is TRUE for a missing `ran`; a missing `switch_present`
//                       makes the pre-flight inert; a missing `null_arm_pct` silently fails the
//                       overshoot quiet-check. A renamed field validates and reads as a control.
//   task_graph        — the gate counts edges with `enforced_by === 'launch_boundary'`. A graph that
//                       names that column anything else reports "0 edges enforced only by a launch
//                       boundary", which reads as the FINDING "nothing to unfuse" rather than "the
//                       column was never filled in". The shipped gate's own comment says these two
//                       must not look alike; the schema was what let them.
//   resource_timeline — the gate DROPS any pipe row whose `utilization_pct` is not finite. A
//                       five-pipe table with the field misnamed arrives as an empty table and is
//                       reported as PIPE TABLE MISSING.
//   candidate_directions — the ladder. Omit `gated_on` and every rung looks unconditional: the gate
//                       finds no unmet prerequisite and reports OK on precisely the run whose
//                       ordering was lost.
//   ledger            — memoryMerge keys rows by `id`. A row without one merges as a new row every
//                       round, which is indistinguishable from normal ledger growth.
//
// The check below is mechanical: lift each `<<REPLAY:*>>` gate, collect the property names it reads,
// and assert each is declared somewhere in the schemas. It is deliberately a whole-file search
// rather than a per-schema one — pinning which schema owns which gate would encode today's wiring
// and break on a rename, and the failure this catches (the name is nowhere) survives that looseness.
