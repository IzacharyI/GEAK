// Every private workspace must be a git repo, and every patch must be produced by diffing it.
//
// WHY. Five places in this workflow build a private workspace with the same tar-pipe, and all five
// exclude `.git` deliberately: the source history may carry an optimized or reference-derived tree,
// and an engineer who can `git show` it is one command away from copying the answer. That exclusion
// is correct and stays.
//
// What was missing is the other half. Director's two copies (workspace, validation_workspace) run
// `git init` + one commit afterwards, so HEAD is exactly the baseline and `git diff` regenerates the
// patch. The engineer, integrator and verify copies did not. In those, `cd $KERNEL_PATH && git diff`
// either fails or — worse — silently reports against whatever ancestor repo sits above the
// workspace. A wave's TechLead recorded the consequence verbatim: "Diffs there are hand-maintained
// and must be re-verified with `git apply --check`." A hand-maintained diff is a second source of
// truth for a change that already has one, and it drifts.
//
// The fix is `git init` in the fresh copy, NOT copying `.git` in. A fresh one-commit repo carries no
// history, so it adds nothing to the reference-containment sweep surface and leaks nothing.
//
// This test reads the shipped recipes as text because they ARE text — the workflow hands these
// snippets to agents to run. There is no function to lift.
