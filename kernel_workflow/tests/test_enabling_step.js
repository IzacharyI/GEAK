// A step that ENABLES a fusion is not a step that speeds one up.
//
// The round filter is `primSpeedup(ver) > 1.0`. For a fusion built in stages that is not a quality
// bar, it is a structural block: the producer half adds completion signalling and a second buffer,
// has no consumer yet, and can only measure its own overhead. It is supposed to be slower. Under a
// speed-only filter it is discarded, never enters the canonical tree, and the consumer half is then
// written against a tree where the producer half does not exist -- so it is never written at all.
// That is how this project reached a half-fused kernel and stopped there.
//
// Each assertion below is a way the fix could be wrong in a way nobody would notice:
//   - `enabling` becomes a way to commit anything, including a step that does not work
//   - a prerequisite is committed but its cost vanishes, so the tree silently gets slower
//   - the debt is tracked but never comes due, so a chain can be abandoned half-built in silence
//   - the terminal step is measured against the degraded tree and credited with removing the
//     overhead its own prerequisites installed
