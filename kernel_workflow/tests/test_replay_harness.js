// The replay harness is the first thing in this suite that tests BEHAVIOUR rather than prose, so it
// had better be tested that way itself.
//
// Every other suite here asserts that a sentence is present in a role file or that a regex matches
// the workflow source. That catches a deletion and nothing else: a change to the gate arithmetic
// that silently re-decides finished runs passes all of them. `scripts/replay_runs.js` exists to
// close that hole by re-deciding recorded runs on no GPU. This file proves it can:
//
//   1. it computes the paired effect the way the discipline requires (within-rep, rank-max, VOID
//      arms dropped whole);
//   2. it pairs the two arms of a control by WORKSPACE, not by whichever arm is declared base —
//      the mistake that made a real +4.5% control read +2.5% and abort a run;
//   3. a change to the gate in kernel_workflow.js CHANGES ITS OUTPUT. Without this assertion the
//      harness could be a no-op that always prints the same thing, which would be worse than having
//      no harness, because the clean --check would be read as evidence.
//
// The corpus is synthesised here rather than shipped, so the test runs in any checkout and carries
// no measurement from any particular machine.
