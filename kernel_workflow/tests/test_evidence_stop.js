// A round that measured nothing must not be counted as a round that found nothing.
//
// `max_no_improve` exists to stop a search that has run out of ideas. To conclude that, the round
// has to have looked. Wave 14 launched with budget 8 and max_no_improve 3, ran three rounds, spent
// seven of its eight budget units and two of its GPU leases, and stopped at the top of round 4 with
// a lease still in the budget and round 4 named in its own plan as the round that had to spend it.
// Of the three rounds the counter charged, exactly one had measured a candidate. Round 1's three
// directions returned static analysis and copies of the baseline latencies; round 2's two returned
// the same. The run ended because a counter meant for "no more wins" had been fed two rounds of
// "no readings".
//
// The rule this file pins: a round produces evidence only when at least one direction returns a
// number the round is allowed to believe, judged by the SAME admissibility the promotion path uses.
// The failure modes are all ways the exemption could be written too narrowly (and one earlier
// version was: it required EVERY direction to be `inactive`, so one direction returning nothing at
// all broke it, and "never got the lease" was never `inactive` to begin with) or too widely (a VOID
// reading counted as evidence, which puts the stopping criterion back where it started).
