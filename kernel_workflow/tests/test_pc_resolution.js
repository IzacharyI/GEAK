// Behavioral test for how the positive-control gate decides an effect is RESOLVED -- told apart from
// the interleave rather than merely large.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The gate had one resolution test: the effect must be RESOLVE_K times the worst
// null pair. That is correct when the null scatters around a centre and wrong when it is a mixture.
// On 2026-08-23 the 512_rank-mixed-skew guard was measured 10 times against itself: nine pairs inside
// 3pp and one at 9.02pp, because that guard drops into a discrete slow state on roughly one run in
// five. A candidate measured over the same interleave read +17.34% median, 10/10 pairs positive,
// range +14.30..+18.65, with the two arms' raw readings not overlapping at all -- and scored 1.9x,
// a FAIL. One draw from a tail set the whole criterion.
//
// So a second route was added: the effect pairs and the null pairs, by magnitude, do not overlap.
// The risk in adding ANY second route is that it is a way to pass, and the thing it must not do is
// rescue a control that genuinely sits inside its own null. The load-bearing assertions here are the
// negative ones -- most of all that wave 10's real control, the one that motivated looking at this
// code at all, STILL FAILS.
//
// Like the other gate tests, this LIFTS the shipped block from between the <<REPLAY:pc_gate>>
// markers and runs it, so it cannot drift away from what ships.
