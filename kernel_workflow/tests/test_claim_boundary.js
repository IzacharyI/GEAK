// Behavioral test for the claim boundary: the three decisions that determine whether a measurement
// that happened on hardware reaches the scoring harness.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-23 a real, reproducible, bit-identical +20.6% at one route guard was
// measured three separate times and scored zero times — once because the engineer's declared patch
// did not exist (the effect lived only in bench CLI flags), once because the engineer wrote a
// correct claim to disk and kept measuring past the round's deadline, so the round closed with no
// StructuredOutput. The instrument worked every time. The loss was entirely at this boundary. The
// repairs went in without a test, which means nothing would have gone red if either had regressed
// to silence — and silence is exactly the failure mode. Hence this file.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A SOURCE-GREP TEST. Same house rule as test_task_graph_gate.js: it LIFTS the shipped
// predicates out of kernel_workflow.js between the `<<REPLAY:claim_boundary>>` markers and runs
// them. If the shipped code changes, this test runs the changed code.
