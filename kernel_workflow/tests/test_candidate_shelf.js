// The candidate shelf: verified non-winners kept as offers instead of collapsing to a number.
//
// Before it, a round remembered exactly one thing — the winner. A direction that PASSED independent
// verification at 1.03x and lost to a 1.09x survived only as `{id, claimed, verified, status}` in
// the round record, so round 5 could not combine with it, could not build on it, and would happily
// re-derive it. On this task the budget is 8 rounds of an 8-GPU collective with one lease per round,
// which makes re-deriving a finished result the most expensive mistake available.
//
// The whole difficulty is deciding whether a shelved patch STILL APPLIES. A patch is a diff against
// the CANONICAL that existed when it was cut, and every committed winner moves CANONICAL out from
// under everything on the shelf. So the test is mechanical — file sets — and this suite exists
// mostly to pin the two ways a mechanical test can quietly become a rubber stamp:
//
//   1. An empty file set read as orthogonality. "Touches nothing" is the maximally-combinable
//      answer, and it is exactly what an agent that forgot the field produces. It must read as
//      UNKNOWN and be withheld.
//   2. Aging that depends on the integrator saying which patches it used. If a superseded candidate
//      stays on offer whenever `best.patches` is omitted, the offer is unsound by default.
//
// It lifts the pure region out of kernel_workflow.js the way replay_runs.js does, so what is tested
// is the shipped code rather than a copy of it.
