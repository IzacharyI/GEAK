// separate pre-dispatch quant launch. Until this gate existed nothing in the workflow counted
// launches, so a candidate that fused dispatch+gemm1 but still launched combine on its own ran three
// launches and read exactly like a real two-launch fusion. This gate makes the count a stated number
// and reports whether the two-launch shape was actually reached. It never rejects; each assertion
// below is a way that reporting could silently go wrong.
