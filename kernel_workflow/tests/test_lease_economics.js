// Guard for the knowledge that was being carried in a per-WAVE task string instead of in the
// workflow itself.
//
// Five waves of a multi-rank fusion program produced three facts that decide how a round should be
// planned and how an A/B should be authored:
//   1. the fused kernel could not be compile-screened AT ALL (it calls the comm runtime at trace
//      time), so every hypothesis cost a full multi-rank run;
//   2. the device pool was ONE lease with a hard 900 s cap, so a round's GPU capacity is one
//      direction and a plan that only reports at the end reports nothing;
//   3. an env-gated arm on a caching JIT can dispatch the SAME binary on both arms, which reads
//      1.000 with every gate satisfied.
// All three were written into the wave's task text. A task string is consumed once and thrown away;
// the next environment starts without any of it, and a human has to remember to re-type it. That is
// the failure this file exists to prevent: durable knowledge belongs in the workflow, and the
// assertions below are what stop it from being summarised back out.
