// Wiring guard for the overlap doctrine added from the megakernel/PDL literature review.
//
// These are not documentation assertions for their own sake. Each one guards a specific way the
// workflow can produce a CONFIDENTLY WRONG result, and each is placed on the surface the agent that
// could make that mistake actually reads:
//
//   1. Sub-timers under concurrency. Per-stage timers are only additive while stages are
//      serialized. A successful overlap inflates them. If the benchmark contract does not say so,
//      the first working fusion in this workflow gets reported as a regression and reverted. This
//      is the highest-cost failure in the set because it destroys a correct result silently.
//   2. Attribution. A fused win that was really launch-overhead removal means the megakernel was
//      the wrong build; without the ablation ladder nobody can tell.
//   3. The reduction test. Condition 1 of the precondition test is checkable statically in minutes
//      and kills most candidate edges. Skipping it buys a fusion designed around an impossible
//      overlap.
//   4. Compiler hoisting. `const __restrict__` on cross-block state defeats the readiness wait at
//      compile time and produces plausible stale data that passes tolerance checks.
//   5. Event pairing. `whole` as the default is what makes a fusion bisectable.
