// Guards on ACTIVATION, added after a round was spent measuring code that never executed.
//
// What happened: the engineer shipped its fast path behind an env-gated opt-in that defaulted OFF.
// Nobody set it. The candidate arm therefore ran the same instructions as the base arm, the harness
// dutifully reported 1.000x, and the round recorded the direction as tried-and-failed. It had not
// been tried. The three readings that must never again collapse into one number:
//
//   A. the code ran and was no faster        -> a real negative result, charge it to noImprove
//   B. the code never ran                    -> VOID, charge nothing, fix activation
//   C. nobody checked which of A or B it was -> must be treated as B, or B is always cheaper to reach
//
//   1. DECLARED   — the engineer states how its code turns on, and default_on is the required norm.
//   2. THREADED   — that declaration reaches verify, or verify is told it is UNDECLARED.
//   3. OBSERVED   — verify reports a marker it actually saw, not a restatement of the claim.
//   4. VOID != NULL — an unconfirmed activation is excluded from wins AND from the stopping rule.
