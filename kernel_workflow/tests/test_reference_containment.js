// Guard for the reference-containment assertion, added after the SECOND imported-answer incident.
//
// tests/test_capability_eval.js already covers the doctrine half: engineers are never handed the
// reference location, the roadmap is scrubbed, and verify rejects byte-identical files. All of that
// was in place and correctly worded during wave 2 — and wave 2 still filed a candidate whose 11 of
// 12 files were byte-identical to the sibling reference checkout, differing only in the default of
// one `os.environ.get` call. Wave 1 had done the same at 8 of 11.
//
// The reason is structural, not behavioural: the reference tree lived one directory above the
// workspace. Not telling an agent where something is does not stop `ls ..`. So containment is now
// asserted at startup rather than requested in prose:
//
//   1. IT ABORTS      — a reference inside the run's own tree stops the run before any budget.
//   2. ANCESTOR       — "inside" means the common ancestor of task + workflow + artifacts, not cwd.
//   3. IT PASSES OUT  — a relocated reference runs normally (the fix must be usable).
//   4. HONEST SCOPE   — the pass log admits a path check cannot cover git-reachable copies.
