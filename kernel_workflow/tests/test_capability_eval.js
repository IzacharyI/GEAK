// Guards for capability-evaluation mode, added after a run imported its own answer.
//
// What happened: the prior-art sweep (test_measurement_gates.js #2) worked exactly as designed. It
// found a reference implementation beside the workspace and told everyone about it — path, branch,
// HEAD — in roadmap.md, which engineers read. An engineer's patch came back containing a 511-line
// file BYTE-IDENTICAL to that reference, measured +4.3%, and demonstrated nothing about the
// workflow's ability to optimize anything.
//
// The doctrine was not wrong. "Do not re-derive working code, port it" is correct when the goal is a
// fast kernel. It is destructive when the goal is measuring whether the workflow can PRODUCE a fast
// kernel. Two contexts, opposite instructions, and previously only one of them was expressible.
//
//   1. MODE EXISTS      — capability_eval is a real, default-OFF switch (OFF must be byte-identical).
//   2. ASYMMETRY        — locations reach VERIFY (which needs them to compare) and never engineers.
//   3. PROVENANCE GATE  — byte-identical files are status:"plagiarized", regardless of speedup.
//   4. NOT SILENT       — a rejected-but-fast direction is logged, not just filtered away.
