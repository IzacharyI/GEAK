// ON-HARDWARE ACTIVATION GATE.
//
// The failure this closes, in full: a fused MegaMoE arm (the D1/D2 producer-readiness + combine
// consumer rewrite) was authored behind a default-OFF env switch and carried across eight rounds. It
// was green on every static screen the workflow knows how to run — py_compile, an OFF-path compile
// check, a CPU dry-run, and a COMPILE_ONLY ISA-distinctness hash that satisfied `artifact_distinct`.
// Its ON path had never once traced or launched on a card. The first time it was run on hardware, it
// crashed at JIT-trace time ("cannot evaluate dynamic 'Boolean' as Python bool during tracing"), a
// fault no static screen can see because the ON kernel variant only compiles when the switch is set at
// run time. The wave banked eight rounds of scaffolding whose perf-bearing path did not exist.
//
// Two things let that happen and both are fixed here:
//   1. `activation_confirmed:"yes"` (a host marker) and `artifact_distinct:"yes"` (a static ISA hash)
//      are both satisfiable WITHOUT a card. The commit/enabling gate trusted them. Now, on a wave that
//      sets `require_hardware_activation`, a committable/enabling candidate must ALSO report
//      `activation_on_hardware:"yes"` — the switched path traced+launched on a device this round.
//   2. working_kernel exempts itself from the no-improve AND no-evidence stops (a debug round is
//      non-improving by construction; a crashing-on-device terminal round is real progress). It must
//      NOT exempt itself from "nothing reached a card at all". A separate `noHardware` counter, live
//      under every objective, hard-stops the wave after MAX_NO_HARDWARE such rounds and surfaces it.
