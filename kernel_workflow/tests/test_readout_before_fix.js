// Guard for plan_round rule 3b: when the blocker is an opaque RUNTIME failure, the round's first
// direction is an instrument, not a fix.
//
// This rule was written after a program spent three consecutive rounds dispatching fix arms at one
// megakernel illegal access. Both rounds that actually moved the blocker were readout rounds (a
// compile-time phase ladder; a debug dump of the disputed bound). The four-fix round in between was
// marker-proved to have executed and changed nothing.
//
// The rule is prose in a role file, which is exactly the kind of thing that gets summarised away
// under a re-flow. The assertions below are the ratchet. They deliberately pin the INCIDENT NUMBERS
// as well as the rule: without them the paragraph reads as methodology advice and gets skipped when
// a round is under budget pressure, which is precisely when it is load-bearing.
