// Behavioral test for the Analyze-phase pipe-occupancy gate.
//
// Same house rule as test_task_graph_gate.js: this LIFTS the shipped gate verbatim out of
// kernel_workflow.js between its `<<REPLAY:pipe_occupancy_gate>>` markers and runs it, rather than
// grepping the source for a phrase. A grep test goes green the moment somebody writes the words.
//
// WHAT THE GATE IS FOR. The dependency graph answers whether two pieces of work MAY overlap. That
// question is necessary and not sufficient, and a program that only asks it will spend wave after
// wave on directions that are perfectly derivable from a correct graph and foreclosed by a counter
// nobody collected. That is not hypothetical: one program ran four waves of occupancy, launch-count
// and communication-overlap arms, then took hardware counters for the first time and found no pipe
// above 41%, HBM at 7-8%, an inter-kernel gap of 0.00us over 72 boundaries, and occupancy already
// kill-gated at both ends. Every lever it had bought was dead before it was bought.
//
// So the gate does three things, and the tests below are one per thing: it prints the table, it
// DERIVES the class from the numbers instead of trusting the stated one, and it prices each
// direction against the pipe it claims to fill.
