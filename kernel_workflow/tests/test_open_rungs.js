// A rung is closed by a verified number, not by having been planned.
//
// The wave-14/15 chain this exists to prevent: analyze produced a four-rung ladder ending in the
// fusion rung the program existed to reach. The rung below it was planned, its device arm hit an
// illegal memory access, and it was retired -- but `dispatchedRungs` is filled from what a round
// PLANNED, so it counted as taken and nothing was recorded as owed. The fusion rung's producer side
// was written in a later round and measured by nobody. The wave ended with the ladder nominally
// clear, the handover note inside one engineer's round directory, and no measurement. The next wave
// started from an empty ladder and never saw any of it.
//
// So: openRungs() must keep a rung that faulted, keep a rung that ran and produced nothing, keep a
// rung nobody ever took, and drop only a rung with a verified number -- including one that lost.
