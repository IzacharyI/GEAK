// Behavioral test for the Analyze-phase task-graph gate (args.require_task_graph).
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT A SOURCE-GREP TEST. The house rule for changes to kernel_workflow.js is that they
// are validated by BEHAVIOR, not by asserting that a phrase appears in the source — a grep test
// passes just as happily on a comment as on working code, and it goes green the moment someone
// writes the words while the logic says something else. So this file LIFTS the gate verbatim out of
// kernel_workflow.js between its `<<REPLAY:task_graph_gate>>` markers and runs it, exactly as
// scripts/replay_runs.js does for the positive-control gate. If the shipped function changes, this
// test runs the changed function.
//
// WHAT THE GATE IS FOR. The failure it catches is an Analyze phase that asserts "the stages are
// serialized, so fuse them" and is believed, because nothing downstream can tell an analysis from a
// restatement of the launch count. Requiring the graph as an object makes the claim checkable. The
// gate does not abort — an honest partial graph beats a retry loop that eventually returns a
// complete-looking invention — it emits a caveat that travels to the report.
