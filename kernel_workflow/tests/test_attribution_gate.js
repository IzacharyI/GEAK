// This is the KERNEL workflow. Its subject is a kernel, so the number that decides a win has to be
// that kernel's own time against the time of the kernels it replaced. For a single-kernel patch the
// distinction is empty and the workflow was written as if it always were. It is not empty the
// moment a patch changes launch structure, and that is exactly the shape this campaign is chasing.
//
// What went wrong, concretely: a fused candidate ran 4878us against the 4774us of the two kernels
// it replaced -- 2.18% SLOWER -- and was promoted to current best on a +4.24% end-to-end reading.
// The whole 223us was in the gaps between kernels (residual moved +0.0799 -> -0.2178 ms), almost
// certainly because the fused kernel's grid-wide join incidentally aligned every rank's consumer
// start and tightened the next kernel's arrival window. That is a real effect and a barrier would
// buy it far more cheaply, but it is not a fact about the kernel under test, and two subsequent
// rounds were spent looking for a mechanism inside a kernel that had got slower.
//
// So this gate, unlike the overlap gate next to it, REJECTS. Each assertion below is a way that
// decision could silently go wrong:
//
//   - the field is absent and the candidate sails through as if attributed (defect class B: the
//     schema is additionalProperties:true, so an omitted `attribution` validates)
//   - the sign convention is inverted and a regression reads as a win
//   - a flat kernel with an end-to-end win is waved through as "well, it didn't get worse"
//   - the rejection happens silently, so the report shows no candidate rather than a refused one
//   - a run whose engineers never report the field changes behaviour (it must not)
