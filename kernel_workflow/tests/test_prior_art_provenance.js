// Guards on prior-art PROVENANCE, added after a report cleared a run it had never checked.
//
// What happened: the tech_lead's return schema had a `prior_art` array from the start, and the
// orchestrator had a loud `PRIOR ART NOT IN BASELINE:` log ready to fire on it. Neither fired,
// because the model never emitted the key at all — it wrote its prior-art findings as prose in
// roadmap.md, which nothing downstream can read. `Array.isArray(...) ? ... : []` then silently
// turned "no record" into "found none", and the final report went on to state:
//
//   "all prior art identified in analyze was `in_baseline: true` … the fused-megakernel path exists
//    in the tree as an env-gated opt-in … this run was pointed at the right tree."
//
// All three clauses were false — the baseline directory contained no such file and no such env var
// — and the sentence was unfalsifiable from inside the run, because there was nothing to check it
// against. It read as a provenance clearance. What it concealed was that 8 of the winning
// candidate's 11 files had been copied in from a reference tree.
//
//   1. RECORDED vs EMPTY — an omitted key and `[]` are different findings and must not collapse.
//   2. EVIDENCE          — `in_baseline` must name the check that settled it, or be flagged.
//   3. STRUCTURED        — the contract says JSON array, and says prose is not a substitute.
//   4. REPORT CITES      — the report gets the sweep verbatim and may not assert beyond it.
